### Workflow Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sv | boolean | Call for structural variants. | If this option is selected, structural variant calling will be carried out using Sniffles2. | False |
| snp | boolean | Call for small variants | If this option is selected, small variant calling will be carried out using Clair3. | False |
| cnv | boolean | Call for copy number variants. | If this option is selected, copy number variant calling will be carried out using QDNAseq. | False |

### Main options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sample_name | string | Sample name to be displayed in workflow outputs. |  | SAMPLE |
| fast5_dir | string | Directory containing FAST5 signal for basecalling. | This directory will be searched recursively. All FAST5 or POD5 files (depending on which extension you select in the Basecalling Options) in this directory or any subdirectory (no matter how deep) will be basecalled. You may choose to provide a FAST5 directory, or a BAM/CRAM, but not both. |  |
| bam | string | Path to a BAM (or CRAM) containing aligned or unaligned reads. | You may choose to provide a BAM/CRAM, or a FAST5 directory for basecalling, but not both. |  |
| ref | string | Path to a reference FASTA file. | Reference against which to compare reads for variant calling. |  |
| old_ref | string | Reference FASTA file for CRAM input (only required if the CRAM requires realignment) | You do not need to provide this unless the workflow specifically asks you to. If your input CRAM headers do not match the metadata of the input reference, the workflow will assume you want to realign your reads to the new input reference. CRAM files are compressed using the reference, so the read sequences cannot be realigned without the old reference. |  |
| basecaller_cfg | string | Name of the model to use for converting signal and selecting a small variant calling model. | Required for basecalling and/or small variant calling. The basecaller configuration is used to automatically select the appropriate small variant calling model. The model list shows all models that are compatible for small variant calling with this workflow. Only a subset of these models can be used for basecalling with the workflow, these are shown at the top of the list. Models that begin with 'clair3:' cannot be used for basecalling and are included to allow SNP calling on existing datasets. You should select 'custom' to override the basecaller_cfg with basecaller_model_path. | dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.1.0 |
| bam_min_coverage | number | Minimum read coverage required to run analysis. |  | 20 |
| bed | string | An optional BED file enumerating regions to process for variant calling. |  |  |
| annotation | boolean | SnpEff annotation. | If this option is unselected, VCFs will not be annotated with SnpEff. | True |
| phased | boolean | Perform phasing. | This option enables phasing of SV, SNP and modifications, depending on which sub-workflow has been chosen; see [README](README.md#9-phasing-variants) for more details. | False |
| out_dir | string | Directory for output of all workflow results. |  | output |


### Structural variant calling options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| tr_bed | string | Input BED file containing tandem repeat annotations for the reference genome. | Providing a tandem repeat BED can improve calling in repetitive regions. An appropriate tandem repeat BED can be downloaded for your reference genome [from the Sniffles2 repository](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/tree/master/annotations). |  |


### Structural variant benchmarking options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sv_benchmark | boolean | Benchmark called structural variants. | If this option is selected, automated benchmarking of structural variant calls will be carried out using Truvari. | False |


### Small variant calling options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| include_all_ctgs | boolean | Call for variants on all sequences in the reference, otherwise small variants will only be called on chr{1..22,X,Y}. | Enabling this option will call for variants on all contigs of the input reference sequence. Typically this option is not required as standard human reference sequences contain decoy and unplaced contigs that are usually omitted for the purpose of variant calling. This option might be useful for non-standard reference sequence databases. | False |


### Modified base calling options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| force_strand | boolean | Require modkit to call strand-aware modifications. |  | False |


### Basecalling options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| remora_cfg | string | Name of the model to use for calling modified bases. | Required for calling modified bases while basecalling. The model list only shows models that are compatible with this workflow. You should select 'custom' to override the remora_cfg with remora_model_path. |  |
| dorado_ext | string | File extension for Dorado input. | Set this to fast5 if you have not converted your fast5 to pod5. It is recommended to [convert existing fast5 files to pod5 for use with Dorado](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pod5-file-format/blob/master/python/README.md#pod5-convert-from-fast5). | fast5 |
| basecaller_basemod_threads | number | Number of threads to use for base modification calling. | You must set this to > 0 when using a modbase aware model. Modbase calling does not require much additional CPU and should be set carefully when using GPU servers with a small number of CPUs per GPU. | 2 |


### Advanced Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| depth_intervals | boolean | Output a bedGraph file with entries for each genomic interval featuring homogeneous depth. | The output [bedGraph](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html) file will have an entry for each genomic interval in which all positions have the same alignment depth. By default this workflow outputs summary depth information from your aligned reads. Per-base depth outputs are slower to generate but may be required for some downstream applications. | False |
| GVCF | boolean | Enable to output a gVCF file in addition to the VCF outputs (experimental). | By default the the workflow outputs a VCF file containing only records where a variant has been detected. Enabling this option will output additionally a gVCF with records spanning all reference positions regardless of whether a variant was detected in the sample. | False |
| downsample_coverage | boolean | Downsample the coverage to along the genome. | This options will trigger a downsampling of the read alignments to the target coverage specified by --downsample_coverage_target. Downsampling will make the workflow run faster but could lead to non-deterministic variant calls. | False |
| downsample_coverage_target | number | Average coverage or reads to use for the analyses. | This options will set the target coverage for the downsampling stage, if downsampling has been enabled. | 60 |


### Advanced basecalling options

|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| qscore_filter | number | Mean qscore by which to filter reads. Inclusive such that reads with score >= qscore_filter are kept. | The mean qscore of reads is calculated by dorado and rounded to an integer by dorado and stored as a tag in dorado's SAM output. The pipeline separates reads into pass and fail categories based on this SAM tag. | 10 |
| basecaller_chunk_size | number | Number of input files to basecall in each basecalling process. |  | 25 |
| cuda_device | string | GPU device to use for basecalling [cuda:all] | For local execution this can be used to pin GPU tasks to one (or more) specific GPU devices. Use cuda:all to use all available GPU devices, or cuda:<idx>[,idx,...] where idx is an index number of the GPU device to use. | cuda:all |
| basecaller_args | string | Additional command line arguments to pass to the basecaller process. To provide custom arguments to `dorado` from command line proceed as follow: `--basecaller_args="--no-trim"` |  |  |
