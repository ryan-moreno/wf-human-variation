The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [unreleased]
### Changed
- `--phase_vcf`, `--joint_phasing` and `--phase_mod` are now deprecated for `--phased`; see the [README](README.md#9-phasing-variants) for more details.
- `--use_longphase_intermediate` is now deprecated, and `--use_longphase false` will use `whatshap` throughout consistently
- Running `--phase --snp --use_longphase false` will now phase indels too
### Fixed
- CNV report generation fails if there is no consensus on the copy number of a chromosome
    - `Undetermined` category has been added to the `Chromosome Copy Summary` to account for these cases
- `readStats` reports metrics on the downsampled BAM when `--downsample_coverage` is requested.

### Fixed
- `--joint_phasing` generating single-chromosome VCF files.

## [v1.9.1]
### Changed
- ClinVar annotation of SVs has been temporarily removed due to not being correctly incorporated. SnpEff annotations are still produced as part of the final SV VCF.
- New documentation
### Removed
- `--annotation_threads` parameter, as the SnpEff process does not support multithreading.
### Fixed
- Truncated SV VCF header generated from `vcfsort`.

- Missing flagstats file in output directory.


## [v1.9.0]
### Added
- STR workflow report now includes additional plots which display repeat units and interruptions in each supporting read
- CNV workflow now outputs an indexed VCF file to the output directory
### Changed
- Legend symbols in STR genotpying plot
- Unambiguous naming of bedMethyl files generated with `--mod`
    - Unphased outputs will have the pattern `[sample_name].wf_mods.bedmethyl.gz`

### Fixed
- Report step failing if bcftools stats file has only some sub-sections
- Clair3 ignoring the bed file
- merge_haplotagged_contigs incorrectly generating intermediate CRAM when input is BAM
- STR content generation failing due to forward slash in disease name in `variant_catalog_hg38.json`

## [v1.8.3]
### Fixed
- configure-jbrowse breaking on unescaped spaces

### Added
- The SNP workflow will filter the final VCF to only return calls in the regions specified with `--bed`

### Fixed
- sv.filterBam missing output file when creating BAM CSI

## [v1.7.0]

- VCFs generated by the `--sv` option are now automatically annotated with `SnpEff`, incorporating ClinVar annotations
    - This can be switched off with `--skip_annotation`

- `--joint_phasing` and `--phase_vcf` now emit a phased block GTF file to facilitate visualization

### Removed
- `--sv_types`, all SV types are returned without filtering
- `--max_sv_length`, all SVs are returned regardless of maximum size

## [v1.6.1]
### Changed
- GPU tasks are limited to run in serial by default to avoid memory errors
    - Users in cluster and cloud environments where GPU devices are scheduled must use `-profile discrete_gpus` to parallelise GPU work
    - A warning will be printed if the workflow detects it is running non-local execution but the discrete_gpus profile is not enabled
    - Additional guidance on GPU support is provided in our Quickstart

- `--phase_methyl` will output haplotype-level methylation calls, using the HP tags added by whatshap in the wf-human-snp workflow
- `--sv_benchmark` will benchmark SV calls with Truvari
    - The workflow uses the 'NIST_SVs_Integration_v0.6' truth set and benchmarking should be carried out on HG002 data.

### Changed
- Added coverage barrier to wf-human-variation
- When the SNP and SV subworkflows are both selected, the workflow will use the results of the SV subworkflow to refine the SNP calls
    - This new behaviour can be disabled with `--skip_refine_snp_with_sv`
- Updated to Oxford Nanopore Technologies PLC. Public License
- Workflow requires target regions to have 20x mean coverage to permit analysis

### Fixed

### Fixed
- uBAM input no longer requires an index
- CRAM is written to the output directory in all cases where alignment was completed

## [v0.3.1]
### Fixed
- `check_for_alignment` did not support uBAM
- Set `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` to reduce risk of environment bleed

## [v0.3.0]
### Added
- Experimental guppy subworkflow
    - We do not provide a Docker container for Guppy at this time, users will need to override `process.withLabel:wf_guppy.container`

### Changed
- `--ubam` option removed, users can now pass unaligned or aligned BAM (or CRAM) to `--bam`
    - If the input BAM is aligned and the provided `--ref` does not match the SQ lines (exact match to name and size) the file will be realigned to `--ref`
    - If the input CRAM is aligned and the provided `--ref` does not match the SQ lines (exact match to name and size) the file will be realigned to `--ref`, but will also require the old reference to be provided with `--old_ref` to avoid reference lookups
    - If the input is not aligned, the file will be aligned to `--ref`

### Fixed
- Chunks without variants will no longer terminate the workflow at the `create_candidates` step

## [v0.2.3]
### Added
- [`mapula`](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/mapula) used to generate basic alignment QC statistics in both CSV and JSON

### Changed
- Updated Clair3 to 0.1.12 (build 6) which bundles Longphase 1.3 to enable CRAM support and small improvement to accuracy

    - Additionally outputs read counts at 1,10,20,30X coverage thresholds for each region in the input BAM (or each sequence of the reference if no BED is provided)
- Simplified `wf-human-sv` Docker image and conda definition

### Fixed
- Outdated conda environment definitions
- Docker based profiles no longer requires an internet connection to fetch the `cram_cache` cache building script

- "No such property" when using the `minimap2_ubam` alignment step
- Slow performance on `minimap2_ubam` step when providing CRAM as `--ubam`
- Slow performance on `snp:readStats` process

### Removed
- "Missing reference index" warning was unnecessary

## [v0.2.0]
### Added
- An experimental methylation subworkflow has been integrated, using [`modbam2bed`](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed) to aggregate modified base counts (input BAM should have `MM` and `ML` tags), enable this with `--methyl`

### Changed
- Workflow experimentally supports CRAM as input, uBAM input uses CRAM for intermediate files
- Reference FAI is now created if it does not exist, rather than raising an error
- `--sniffles_args` may be used to provide custom arguments to the `sniffles2` process

- `--GVCF` and `--include_all_ctgs` are correctly typed as booleans
    - `--GVCF` now outputs GVCF files to the output directory as intended
    - `--include_all_ctgs` no longer needs to be set as `--include_all_ctgs y`

## [v0.1.1]

- `--ubam_bam2fq_threads` and `--ubam_sort_threads` allow finer control over the resourcing of the alignment step
    - The number of CPU required for `minimap2_ubam` is sum(`ubam_bam2fq_threads`, `ubam_map_threads`, `ubam_sort_threads`)

### Changed
- `--ubam_threads` is now `--ubam_map_threads` and only sets the threads for the mapping specifically
- `--ref` is now required by the schema, preventing obscure errors when it is not provided
- Print helpful warning if neither `--snp` or `--sv` have been specified
- Fastqingress metadata map
- Disable dag creation by default to suppress graphviz warning

### Fixed
- Tandem repeat BED is now correctly set by `--tr_bed`
- Update `fastcat` dependency to 0.4.11 to catch cases where input FASTQ cannot be read
- Sanitize fastq intermittent null object error

### Note
- Switched to "new flavour" CI, meaning that containers are released from workflows independently

## [v0.1.0]
### Added
- Ported wf-human-snp (v0.3.2) to modules/wf-human-snp
